# Super Assistant Agent

This project is a mini agent that organizes your todo list into a realistic day plan, grouping tasks by energy level and prioritizing them.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repo or copy the files.
2. (Optional) Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run: `python main.py`

## How it Works

- Classifies tasks as 'low' or 'high' energy.
- Prioritizes and groups them.
- Outputs a realistic day plan.

## Extending

- Build a web or chat interface.
